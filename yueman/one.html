        Long distance is, I believe, one of the hardest things to do. I've given it lots of thought and I realized
        that you, probably like me, easily forget both past people and our disposition towards them. For me, I've
        realized quite early that I tend to forget things that seemingly "matter" quite often. No, not things like
        my phone. I mean things that matter to life -- connections, people, memories. I can pretty much remember
        history and math lessons taught to me back in elementary school, but I forget the people I meet almost
        instantaneously. Perhaps this is a defense mechanism? Who knows? All I do know is that this will be very
        hard for me. But I've committed to trying -- really trying with all my might. Even though I held you in my
        arms just 24 hours ago, I have a hard time imagining that I can survive all the way to 2020 without you.
        Perhaps this "gift" I am giving you is equally as important to me as I deemed it is to you. I want this to
        be different. I don't want to forget you. I won't forget you.

        Have you heard of this YouTuber? I think you would absolutely LOVE his videos. Check out his most famous one.
        His videos make me want to become a doctor myself. Sucks I'm hemophobic.

        Remember when I was telling you about fundamental patterns in language? "The arbitrary order hidden
        within chaos." I think this video is super interesting and describes the pattern connecting natural
        mathematical phenomena and psychology. Perhaps, despite our complexity and order our brain can create,
        we still unknowingly yield to the universe's mathematics and ultimately quantum mechanic's probability
        distributions? Check it out if you haven't already, this YouTuber is probably one of my favorites ever.

        I can't shake the feeling that we're being foolish. When did you turn into more of a romantic than me? Sometimes
        I wonder how you can be so certain. I think a big reason I didn't want to do long distance was because I'd have
        my faith in myself shaken. I'd miss you so much that my brain would start to consider things more skeptically.

        My sister asked me the other night, 《你真的了解她吗？》 I thought on this for a long time. I realized that while I am
        a rather very open individual, many times it takes me a long time to truly understand someone. To piece together
        what made them who they are, how they view the world, and my own perceptions of how they present themselves. But,
        悦蔓, why is it that after spending this little time with you, I feel like I've known you for years? It is this
        feeling, this feeling of familiarity, that made my heart tremble that night at the bar. It is this feeling that
        makes me doubt not us, but the sanity of those who say it is impossible. It is this feeling that keeps me up at
        night remembering your smile, your laugh, and dumb habits. You tell me you still don't know what it means to love
        someone. To be honest I don't even know anymore either. What I feel for you is miles apart what I've felt for
        anyone else. In Beijing I thought that this must have been hormones in the moment type thing. But thinking back
        on you, even thousands of miles away, makes my heart flutter. That's so special to me. So, even if we don't make it.
        Even if you find another guy who is a better and closer version of me. You'll always have a place close in my
        heart, following me everywhere I go.
