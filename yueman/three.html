        I used to tell my sister all the time about my wife. She's going to be raised in China but moved to America
        during high school. She's going to want to have girls, and have an endless thirst for knowledge. She's going
        to have long black hair, be skinny, and shorter than me. These are some of the endless lists of demands I used
        to present late at night to my sister. I don't even remember them all. She would laugh and tell me, "As you meet
        more people, your list will change and get shorter." I used to think, "How dare she? I think I know myself and my
        tastes very well!" The truth is, you are quite close to that list -- but of course there are places where you
        don't meet the insane standards I set when I was in high school. However, when I called you the other day, I really
        did mean what I said. I think that if I were to talk to my sister now, I'd say that she was right. My list did
        change. And it's all your fault.

        I totally forgot that you were writing stuff too. Thanks a lot, now I miss you so much in class. I think I
        just missed some important information. If I fail, it's on you now.
