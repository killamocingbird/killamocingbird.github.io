            Depending on my level dependability, you may or may not have already received part one of your
            gift. I'm actually really bad at picking out gifts for people, so I hope this is satisfactory.
            This webpage and its branches will serve as a comprehensive guide to accompany you until I see you
            in 2020.  It can and will contain anything from random and interesting thoughts I've had, to weird
            stories about my life, to questions that you can ponder if you get bored (with me of course). With
            such limited time, I decided to make this a dynamic gift that I'll update with stuff I think of
            when I'm unable to talk to you (due to timezone differences or forgetting). If you ever miss me
            and you can't contact me, you can check this page for any updates. (Links will appear at the top
            of the page).
