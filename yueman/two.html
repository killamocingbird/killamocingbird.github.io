        I've always wanted to see the fourth dimension visualized using color. However, I started to think about it and
        how to understand, or rather, "undo" an orthogonal projection into color (of the fourth dimension). I played
        around with this idea in MATLAB for visualization, and wanted to share the results with you! First, let's begin
        with an example of our ability to "undo" the projection of 3D onto 2D.
        <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div align = center>
        <img src = week2graphs/flat-3d-graph.png width = 40%>
        <img src = week2graphs/3d-graph.png width = 40%>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class = txt style = "text-align: justify">
        In this way, it is not hard to animate the frames in which the image on the left transitions to the image
        on the right. We have a mental understanding of how to "undo" the projection. Earlier I said to you how I would
        love to visualize the 4th dimension using such a projection, however, it wouldn't be beautiful at all. It
        would just look like a colored 3D curve, because the true beauty comes from our understanding of how to
        "undo" the dimension, which as 3D creatures, limits us from understanding 3D projections of the 4th dimension.
        See the example below.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div align = center>
        <img src = week2graphs/3d-4d-graph.png width = 40%>
        <img src = week2graphs/3d-4d-graph-fine.png width = 40%>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class = txt style = "text-align: justify">
        The left and right show the same graph but with higher resolution on the right. These two graphs can be viewed
        as if it were the previous left graph. In other words, this 3D graph is a projection of a 4D graph. Unfortunately,
        because we are 3D creatures, I can't visualize the 4 dimensions in MATLAB, and even if I could, it would not be
        understandable. To better see what's going on, it may be helpful to imagine that the colors represent an orthogonal
        dimension which when isolated to from the original 3D shape looks like below.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div align = center>
        <img src = week2graphs/3d-4d-visual.png width = 40%>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class = txt style = "text-align: justify">
        It is important to note that color in the context of the first and third set of images correspond to the height
        or 3rd dimension (that way when it is collapsed into a 2D projection, we can imagine it in our heads as 3D). However,
        in the second set of graphs, color is used to show the 4th orthogonal spatial dimension, which is isolated in the
        last image. Even though it may be beautiful to imagine the 4th dimension, or to model it using color
        on a 3D projection, I found that we are bound by our limited brains. We cannot and will never
        truly be able to fathom, visually, the beauty of higher dimensions. Any thoughts on the subject must happen with cognitive
        dissonance or suspension of disbelief.
        <br>
        <br>
        The closest thing I found to seeing the beauty of the 4th dimension can be found
        <a href = "http://www.rdrop.com/users/half/Creations/Puzzles/visualizing.4D/index.html">here</a>.
        To think that scientists like Einstein were able to come up with a theory grounded in a 4th dimension is amazing.
        The link above is a short but fascinating read.

        I tease you a lot but I don't lie -- I did feel apprehensive about college specifically because I'm worried
        I'd forget about you. But like I said, I worry about everything -- especially when it comes to things involving
        my emotional state. However, even when I'm laughing and having fun in a group, arm wrestling with my neighbor,
        or falling asleep to the smell of steaming rice, I'm always waiting for a message from you. It's as if every
        time I enter a room, part of me is looking for you. How cliche is that?

        I'm not worried anymore.

        I think I'm stupid in love with you.
