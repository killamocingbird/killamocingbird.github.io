        Dear Professor Feng,
        <br><br>
        I think my Chinese skills are declining... Which is a really big problem. My time delay in talking
        to you has increased by a minuscule amount. You know what this means right? This means in order to keep my
        Chinese skills in check we will have to talk even more often! How tragic!!! Oh well, as my Chinese tutor this
        is an unfortunate but very much unavoidable outcome. Perhaps spending so much more time together will make you
        fall in love with me? That also seems like an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence don't you think?
        <br><br>
        Your failing student,<br>
        Justin L. Wang
